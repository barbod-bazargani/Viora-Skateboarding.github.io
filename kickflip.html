        <p> 
         <h3>1. </h3> Place your back foot similar to an Ollie position on the tail.<br>
         Your front foot should be a bit behind the bolts of your front truck and slightly turned with your toes toward the nose of your board so you can slide your foot up the board and off the nose behind you.<br><br>
         <h3>2. </h3>  After you pop your tail, drag your front foot over the grip towards the nose.<br>
         The toe side of your shoe should slide off the nose in a slight angle.
         <h3>3. </h3> This motion across the corner of the nose makes the board do the flipping motion.<br>
         It is almost like a karate kick, hence the term “Kickflip”.
         <h3>4. </h3> After the toes of your front foot have left the nose the board starts to rotate.<br>
         Be patient and practice to find the right amount of power needed in the kick, the right timing and the correct front foot position.
        <h3>5.  </h3> When board is done with rotating try to catch it with your feet on the bolts of your trucks and ride away clean.<br>
        <h3>6.  </h3> It maybe will take some time to get your Kickflips straight but once mastered you can pull them off like Ollies.
