         <h3>1. </h3> While the front foot is positioned between the middle of the board and the bolts of the front truck, the ball of the back foot is placed in the middle of the tail.<br><br>
         <h3>2. </h3> To get yourself and the board off the ground, press the back foot quickly down on the tail towards the ground making a pop like motion.<br><br>
         <h3>3. </h3> As soon as the tail hits the ground, jump upward and slide your front foot from the middle of the board towards the nose simultaneously.<br>
            When the tail hits the ground you will hear the iconic skate sound.
         <h3>4. </h3> It’s important that your front foot is well placed on the grip tape so your front foot doesn’t slide off the board.<br>
         Both the move of popping the tail of the board, jumping and dragging your front foot up the board have to be done in a fluent, well-coordinated, simultaneously motion so you get the proper Ollie motion.
        <h3>5.  </h3> If everything has worked you should be in the middle of the jump phase.<br>
        Now your board is with both trucks up in the air with yourself over it. At the highest point you should prepare yourself for the landing.
        <h3>6.  </h3> Try to land with both feet over the bolts of your trucks and your body over the center of the board to maintain your balance.<br>
        This also keeps you from landing too hard and cracking or breaking your board.
        <h3>7.  </h3> Make sure you bend your knees a little bit to cushion the landing and to keep your center of gravity balanced.<br>
        Now keep doing it until you have it on lock!
