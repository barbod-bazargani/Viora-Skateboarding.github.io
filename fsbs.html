         <h3>1. </h3> Approach the ledge almost parallel while you put your feet in an Ollie position and Ollie up towards the ledge.<br><br>
         <h3>2. </h3> To get the middle of your board on the ledge you have to do half a Backside 180 Ollie, so a Backside 90 degree Ollie. <br>
         Aiming with the middle of your board is not too difficult because the middle of your board has a lot of space to slide on. To prevent your board from cracking you should try not to jump too high and to land smoothly on the rail or ledge.<br><br>
         <h3>3. </h3> To have a good balance while sliding, try to have your feet on top of the bolts of your trucks and your bodyweight centered to avoid slipping back.<br>
         Itâ€™s Important that you only turn your hips into the slide position and keep your shoulders straight. Also, try to look in the direction you are sliding.
         <h3>4. </h3> At the end of the ledge or rail, move your hips back to the straight riding position and roll away clean.<br>
        <h3>5.  </h3> Try to land smooth with your feets above the bolts of your trucks to channel the pressure well.<br>
